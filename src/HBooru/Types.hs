-- | Tags used for searching in sites. No special escaping is done.
-- Note that many sites would treat a tag like "striped panties" as two separate
-- tags and you wouldn't get the results you were after.

instance DataFormat JSON where

-- | Thanks to this class, we're able to provide instances converting
-- from a 'DataFormat' to 'Response'. This is useful if we need a 'DataFormat'
-- while we only have a type that's an instance of 'Response'. Note that the
-- functional dependency currently requires that there is only one way to coerce
-- between two types.
class Response r ⇒ CoerceResponse x r | x → r, r → x where
  -- | Given something and a 'String', we get the appropriate 'Response'.
  -- For example with @instance 'CoerceResponse' 'XML' 'XMLResponse'@:
  --
  -- >>> toResponse XML "<SomeXML></SomeXML>"
  -- XMLReponse "<SomeXML></SomeXML>"
  toResponse ∷ x → String → r
  -- | Given some kind of 'Response', we get the appropriate value back,
  -- depending on the class instance.
  -- For example with @instance 'CoerceResponse' 'XML' 'XMLResponse'@:
  --
  -- >>> fromResponse $ XMLReponse "<SomeXML></SomeXML>"
  -- XML

-- | Class specifying a parser that can fetch posts. A post usually consists of
-- links to the image, samples, and some meta-data. See
-- 'HBooru.Parsers.GenericBooru.GenericPost' for the kind of thing we usually
-- get out. The reason for this class is that sometimes we might get different
-- information based on the 'DataFormat' we use so we use type families to
-- denote this rather than forcing the library user to make do with our best
-- guess on what goes into the post. It also allows us to use different post
-- types for sites that provide different information.
class (Site s, DataFormat r) ⇒ PostParser s r where
  type ImageTy s r
  -- | Given a parser working with 'DataFormat' specified by an instance of
  -- this class, we require through 'CoerceResponse' that it is able to parse
  -- responses in the format so what we actually pass into this function is
  -- the 'Site' this parser works with (so that we can pick the appropriate data
  -- type for the posts) and a 'Response' matching the 'DataFormat' (through a
  -- class instance). For @PostParser 'Gelbooru' 'XML'@ instance, example use
  -- might go like
  --
  -- @
  -- do fc \<- 'XMLResponse' <$> 'readFile' \"gelbooruResponse.xml\"
  --    -- the type of images is actually inferred for us
  --    let images ∷ ['HBooru.Parsers.Gelbooru.GelbooruPost']

class (Site s, DataFormat r) ⇒ Postable s r where
  -- | Given a 'Site', a 'DataFormat' and a list of 'Tag's, an instance of this
  -- class should be able to return a 'String' at which we can find data in
  -- 'DataFormat' format that honours our tags. This is effectively a URL
  -- builder for POST requests.
  postUrl ∷ s → r → [Tag] → String
  -- | Provides information about whether there's a hard limit on the amount of
  -- posts we can fetch from the site at once. The reason for this function here
  -- rather than in 'Site' is that we might be parsing data without an API we
  -- can post to at all and we're getting our data through other means.
  hardLimit ∷ s → Limit

-- | Describes a site for a parser. The reason why this isn't a simple data type
-- is to allow us to write additional parsers in the future without modifying
-- this library if we wish to do so.
class Site s where

-- | Rating used on *booru sites.
data Rating = Safe | Questionable | Explicit deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Denotes whethere there's a hard limit on the number of posts
-- we can fetch at a time from a site. NoLimit implies that we can fetch
-- everything at once and not that we don't know. See 'Counted' for a way to
-- potentially retrieve number of posts present on the site.
data Limit = NoLimit | Limit Integer deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | One of the formats we can receive responses from sites in. For things
-- like parsers parametrisation, use 'XML' instead and use methods in
-- 'CoerceResponse' if you need to.

-- | One of the formats we can receive responses from sites in. For things
-- like parsers parametrisation, use 'JSON' instead and use methods in

data JSONResponse = JSONResponse String deriving Show

-- | Specifies what is considered a response. You'll almost certainly also
-- want new 'DataFormat' and 'CoerceResponse' instances if you're adding some
-- here. This class assumes that all responses carry the response in a string we
-- can extract. Note that this is not for use as network response if you're
-- scraping, only for putting data into after you have done all the error
-- checking and whatnot.
